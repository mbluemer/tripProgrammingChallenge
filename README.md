# Intro
This repo contains a solution submitted to the 2016 TripAdvisor College Programming Challenge. This solution ranked #1 out of submissions from the Univeristy of Connecticut and in the top 5% of solutions from all schools that participated in the challenge.

## Instructions to run
In order to run the program just be in the current directory and run:
```
javac Challenge.java
java Main
```

Then the program parses a specific format of input. Example input can be generated by running:
```
python gen.py
```

# Notes
Due to the time restriction this solution is in no way the most optimal but a simple and robust solution that works with reasonable optimality. If I were to go back and improve the current solution I would use a priority queue that organizes based on job priority and then insert into the queue as the jobs were able to be run (based on start time). This would ensure that the highest priority items would be done first.
